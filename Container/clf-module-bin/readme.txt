In order to setup this project to work on your computer or an unconfigured server:

1. Run StremTagFilter as ADMIN explicitly. You can say 'Disabled' for logging.

2. Run CLFPagePluginSetup, probably in ADMIN though Josh says you shouldn'this

3. Copy the gcwu-fegc templates to C:\Program Files (x86)\Transport Canada\ClfPagePlugin\Templates\ folder

4. Success!
